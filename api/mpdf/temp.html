        <h1 class="heading-text">Terms & Conditions - At A Glance</h1>

        <h1>What you need to know about your shared mailing service &ndash; plain English version</h1>

        <p>A shared mailing is where your leaflet is enclosed into an envelope with up to 9 other compa-nies and sent to a particular target audience. </p>

        <div class="tc-sub-header"><h3>Production and supply of the leaflets </h3>
        </div>

        <div class="gray-heading gray-margin-top"><h3>DESIGN &amp; PRINT SERVICE (WHERE WE DESIGN &amp; PRINT FOR YOU) </h3>
        </div>

        <p>If you&rsquo;ve agreed for us to do your design and print, we&rsquo;ll need you to send across as much information and imagery as you can. Our designers will also talk with you about what you want to achieve from your campaign. We&rsquo;ll provide you with the design deadline dates for each individual mailing you&rsquo;ve joined. We&rsquo;ll need you to work with us to meet these deadlines so that we meet our deadlines with the printers. <span class="bold-text underline-text">You agree that, if we are unable to get final sign-off by the deadline date, that what Meridian Delta considers to be the best and most likely successful drafts (whether seen by you or not) can be forwarded to the printers and that this completes our responsibility for the design part of this order to your satisfaction.</span></p>

        <div class="gray-heading gray-margin-top"><h3>DESIGN ONLY SERVICE (WHERE WE DESIGN &amp; YOU PROVIDE PRINTED MATERIALS) </h3>
        </div>

        <p>When we&rsquo;re doing the design but you&rsquo;re using our design with your own printers, you&rsquo;ll need to let us know your printer&rsquo;s deadline for printing and delivering leaflets to us within the neces-sary timescale. We&rsquo;ll need you to send across as much information and imagery as you can. Our designers will also talk with you about what you want to achieve from your campaign. We&rsquo;ll need you to work with us to meet your printer&rsquo;s deadline. Your leaflet will need to ar-rive as a folded A4 to A5 sheet on paper no heavier than 135gsm.</p>

        <div class="gray-heading gray-margin-top"><h3>POST ONLY SERVICE (WHERE YOU PROVIDE US WITH THE LEAFLETS) </h3>
        </div>

        <p>We&rsquo;ll provide you with the dates by which your leaflets will need delivery to us for inclusion in your shared mailing. Your leaflet will need to arrive as a folded A4 to A5 sheet on paper no heavier than 135gsm.</p>

        <div class="tc-sub-header"><h3>Cancellations and refunds</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="gray-heading gray-margin-top"><h3>FAILURE TO MEET AGREED DEADLINES FOR DESIGN, PRINT &amp;/OR DELIVERY TO US</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Shared mailings are a low-margin advertising service with limited space availability. Before you agree to this booking, we need you to know that you are responsible for making sure that your leaflets arrive with us on time for inclusion. What we need you to do for each of the ser-vice levels is listed above. If, for any reason that is not Meridian Delta&rsquo;s responsibility, we do not receive what we need to include you in your shared mailing, this does not give rise to a refund.</p>

        <div class="gray-heading gray-margin-top"><h3>FAILURE TO PROVIDE PRINTING ON CORRECT PAPER </h3>
        </div>
        <p>Shared mailings require us to produce envelopes under a given weight. The maximum weight of your paper is 135gsm. If you provide us with heavier paper, we will not include it in the shared mailing and this will not give rise to a refund.</p>

        <div class="gray-heading gray-margin-top"><h3> LOW OR NO RESPONSES TO YOUR LEAFLETS </h3>
        </div>
        <p>No advertising is guaranteed to work in the sense that it produces enquiries or sales. Meridian Delta&rsquo;s responsibility for the service ends at the successful delivery into the target markets of your leaflet together with the leaflets of your advertisers. Failure to produce a response or make a sale does not give rise to a refund. Please satisfy yourself that, before joining the service, that you are prepared for all outcomes, positive and negative.</p>

        <div class="tc-sub-header"><h3>About the data I get with my shared mailing</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="gray-heading gray-margin-top"><h3>HOW CAN I FOLLOW UP MY SHARED MAILINGS WITH FURTHER MARKETING? </h3>
        </div>
        <p>On the day of dispatch, our admin team will send you a download containing the details of the organisations who will receive your information, including telephone numbers and contact ad-dresses. Please note that the information does not contain email addresses. You have a li-cence to use that data for 12 months after your shared mailing has been dispatched. Usage of the information after this time scale will result in additional charges at the standard rate of the relevant data as listed on www.meridiandelta.com at that time. Where a company has bought from you or enquired about your service as a result of the shared mailing or usage of the data, this data is no longer considered as licenced and you can use it for internal marketing pur-poses as you would any other data your company has title over.</p>

        <div class="tc-sub-header"><h3>Proof of service</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="gray-heading gray-margin-top"><h3>HOW DO I KNOW YOU&rsquo;LL DO WHAT YOU&rsquo;LL SAY YOU&rsquo;LL DO?</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Visibility and transparency are two of the most important parts of Meridian Delta&rsquo;s work with customers, whichever service they choose. Meridian Delta works with partners to print the leaflets, insert them into the envelopes and dispatch the shared mailings. All of the work we do with partners produces paper trails, for example a postal docket. We will include, with your paper/posted invoice, a copy of the postal docket containing your shared mailing. Should you require further proof, we will make other items available to you. You will, of course, also know who we have sent the shared mailings to as we will provide you with their contact details.</p>

        <div class="tc-sub-header"><h3>Finance and payment</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="gray-heading gray-margin-top"><h3>WHEN DOES THIS SERVICE BECOME PAYABLE? </h3>
        </div>
        <p>For our customers&rsquo; conveniences, we ask for payment 30 days after the day that the shared mailing has been dispatched. In order to assist us, we use invoice factoring facilities provided by GC Factoring Limited. It is to GC Factoring Limited that all invoices are payable. If we are unable to secure this facility for you, we will ask you for payment prior to dispatch. However, failure to secure the facility to you means you can cancel this agreement within 2 working days after we notify you.</p>

        <div class="gray-heading gray-margin-top"><h3>INVOICING </h3>
        </div>
        <p>Many customers will book multiple slots in multiple shared mailings with us. Each shared mail-ing gives rise to a new invoice. For example, if there are 6 shared mailing slots listed on the front page of this booking form, each slot will generate its own invoice and that invoice will become payable after 30 days.</p>

        <div class="gray-heading gray-margin-top"><h3>DIVISIBILITY OF AN INVOICE FROM ALL OTHER ACTIVITY </h3>
        </div>
        <p>Each shared mailing we perform for you will generate a separate invoice. It will be separate from all other shared mailings or any other services you purchase from us. An invoice (either in part or in whole) can only be considered on its own and not offset against any other invoice. </p>
